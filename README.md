Algorithm Visualizer

Algorithm Visualizer is a Python-based GUI application built using Tkinter that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms in action. It helps learners understand how sorting algorithms work through animated graphical representations.

Features

* Visualizes sorting algorithms in real-time
* Supports the following algorithms:

  * Bubble Sort
  * Insertion Sort
  * Selection Sort
  * Merge Sort
  * Quick Sort
* Adjustable speed of visualization
* Random data generation on each run
* Displays time and space complexity of the selected algorithm


Getting Started

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-visualizer.git
   cd algorithm-visualizer

2. Run the application:
   python algorithm\ visualizer.py


Time & Space Complexities

| Algorithm      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Bubble Sort    | O(n²)           | O(1)             |
| Insertion Sort | O(n²)           | O(1)             |
| Selection Sort | O(n²)           | O(1)             |
| Merge Sort     | O(n log n)      | O(n)             |
| Quick Sort     | O(n log n)      | O(log n)         |
